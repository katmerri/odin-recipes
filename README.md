Recipe Site project for the Odin Project
While using the foundations I've learned so far, I will
build an HTML site.

Practicing using the command line to:
* clone repository to personal machine
* open repository
* open project in VScode
* navigate through directories and create new files (ex. .html)
* git add and git commit - saving iterations to machine repository and pushing to github

Practicing HTML tags and attributes:
* HTML Boilerplate
* main header, description header 
* anchor tag with href attribute - relative links and absolute links
* unordered lists, ordered lists, and lists tags
* header for the list
* paragraphs
* image on page, including image sizing and alt attribute
