Recipe Site project for the Odin Project
While using the foundations I've learned so far, I will
build an HTML site.

Practicing using the command line to:
* clone repository to personal machine
* open repository
* open project in VScode
* navigate through directories and create new files (ex. .html)
* git add and git commit - saving iterations to machine repository and pushing to github

Practicing HTML tags and attributes:
* HTML Boilerplate
* <h1> main header, <h3> description header
* <a> href attribute - relative links
* <ul> unordered lists, <ol> ordered lists, and <li> lists
* <hx> header for the list
* <p> paragraphs
* <img src> image on page
