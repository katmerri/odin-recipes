# odin-recipes

Recipe Site project for the Odin Project
While using the foundations I've learned so far, I will
build a HTML site.

Practicing using the command line to:
* clone repository to personal machine
* open repository
* open project in VScode
* navigate through directories and create new files (ex. .html)

Practicing HTML tags and attributes:
* HTML Boilerplate
* <h1> 
* <a> href attribute - relative links
