        <li>1/4 Cup Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Dark Molasses</li>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li> 2 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>
    <hx>Rolling:</hx>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 Cup Granulated Sugar, for rolling</li>
    </ul>

    <hx>Instructions:</hx>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and 
            salt together until combined well. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl beat the butter and both sugars on high speed until
            creamy and combined, about 2 minutes. Add the molasses and beat until combined.
            Then add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape
            down sides and bottom of bowl as needed.
        </li>
        <li>On low speed, slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until
            combined. The cookie dough will be slightly sticky. Cover dough tightly with 
            aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with aluminum foil.
            Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Remove cookie dough from the fridge. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 2 hours, let 
            it sit at room temperatur for at least 30 minutes. The cookies may not spread
            in the oven if the dough is that cold. Roll dough, 1 Tbsp each, into balls.
            Roll each ball in granulated sugar and arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. 
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 11-12 minutes or until edges appear set. If the tops aren't appearing
            cracked as pictured, remove the baking sheet from the oven and gently bang on the 
            counter 2-3x. This will help those warm cookies spread out and crack on top. Return to over.
        </li>
        <li> Remove cookies from oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes
            before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy, cookies will stay fresh covered for 1 week.</li>
